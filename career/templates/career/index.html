    <h3>📍 About Me</h3>
    <p>
        I’m a 13-year-old junior tennis player currently ranked <strong>#356 in Europe</strong> (Tennis Europe).<br>
        I've competed at top junior events in <strong>Bulgaria</strong>, <strong>Cyprus</strong>, and <strong>Ukraine</strong>,
        and I’ve trained at the <strong>Rafa Nadal Academy</strong> in Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m half Ukrainian and half Armenian, and I represent both cultures through my tennis, my work ethic, and my journey toward becoming a pro.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also share my tennis lifestyle—training, match days, travel, and gear—on my social media to inspire younger players and connect with tennis fans around the world.
        <br><strong>My birthday is the 4th November 2011</strong>
